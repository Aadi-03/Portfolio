                                <p> Hi! I’m <span>Aaditva Vijay Vats</span>, a Computer Science & Engineering (AI) student at the <span>Institute of Engineering and Technology, Lucknow</span>. I’m deeply passionate about creating smart, innovative solutions through code, with a solid academic background (CGPA 8.92) and a drive to explore the ever-evolving tech landscape.

From building real-time communication platforms to face recognition systems, I enjoy working on projects that combine creativity and technical skills. </p>
<p>My toolkit includes <span>Python, C++, SQL, React, and Django</span>, and I’m always eager to learn and apply the latest technologies. Whether it's a desktop application for efficient invoice management or a weather app that provides global forecasts, I’m dedicated to crafting practical, user-friendly solutions.

I’m also an avid problem-solver, continually refining my skills in <span>data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming</span>. With good rankings on platforms like CodeChef, Codeforces, and LeetCode, I push myself to tackle complex coding challenges.
</p>
<p>

Beyond technical skills, I believe in strong teamwork, leadership, and effective communication, which help me bring out the best in any project.
</p>
<p><span>Let's create impactful tech solutions together!</span></p>
